# Mutable Data

In Flix, the primitive mutable data types are:

- [References](./references.md)
- [Arrays](./arrays.md)

from which we can build higher-level data structures, such as mutable lists, deques, sets, and maps.

But before we can use these, we have to understand the concept of [Regions](./regions.md).
