Flix comes with a fully-featured Visual Studio Code Extension:

The extension uses the real Flix compiler and supports almost all of LSP.

Flix also comes with an (optional) Visual Studio Code color theme called "Flixify Dark".

# Installation and Use

The Flix extension can be installed from the marketplace.
It will automatically download the latest stable version of the Flix compiler.
Alternatively, the Flix compiler (`flix.jar`) can be placed in the root of the project folder.

> **Note:** The Flix extension only works when a folder is opened in VSCode, not for a single file.
