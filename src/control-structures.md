# Control Structures

Flix being a functional programming language has few control-structures; most
control is simply function application. The Flix control structures are:

- [If-Then-Else](./if-then-else.md)
- [Pattern Matching](./pattern-matching.md)
- [For-Each and For-Yield](./foreach-foryield.md)

> **Note:** Flix does not have traditional `while` or `for`-loops. Instead, we
> recommend the use recursion and/or one of the above constructs.
