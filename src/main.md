## The Main Function

The entry point of any Flix program is the `main` function which _must_ have the
signature:

```flix
def main(): Unit \ IO
```

That is, the `main` function:

1. must return `Unit`, and
2. must be marked as effectful (i.e. have the effect annotation `\ IO`).

The signature of `main` does not specify any arguments, but the command line
arguments passed to the program can be accessed by calling
`Environment.getArgs()`:

```flix
def main(): Unit \ IO =
    let args = Environment.getArgs();
    ...
```

Flix requires `main` to have the `IO` effect. If main was pure there would be no
reason to run the program. Typically the effectful requirement is satisfied
because `main` prints to the console or has another side-effect.
